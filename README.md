# TypeScript Chess game

This application is a simple chess game using only TypeScript, HTML and SASS. In this project, i was able to start learning TypeScript without the help of any javascript framework like Agular.js or Vue.js. This application has been deployed via netlify and you can see [here](https://moscachess.netlify.app/)

## Features 
This game has almost all the features that a real chess game has. Except for the Pawn promotion, all the others special rules such as castling, en passant, check, checkmate and stalemate are included in the game
